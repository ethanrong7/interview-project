In addition, the Arup culture was also present throughout the program which is very supportive and accepting. Everyone at Arup is extremely welcoming and inclusive which definitely made me feel like a valued part of the team.  '),

I''ve met other females during the program and it was interesting to see what background they came from but it occured by chance during a meeting. Despite it being short-lived experience, I had  a wonderful time learning the different projects that Transurban manage and it was fascinating to learn how they capture traffic data to optimise traffic flow.
